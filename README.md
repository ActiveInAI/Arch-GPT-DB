### AI SQL Assistant

Describe what you want in plain language — get SQL back. Arch-GPT DB can explain queries, optimize SQL, fix errors, and run AI-generated SQL through built-in safety checks. Works with Claude, OpenAI, local models, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

### Data Grid

Virtual-scrolled table that handles large result sets. Inline editing, SQL preview before save, WHERE / ORDER BY controls, DataGrip-style filters, LIKE / NOT LIKE context filters, sorting, full-text search, pagination, column resize, auto-fit, row numbers, zebra stripes, and full cell details. Export or copy as CSV, JSON, Markdown, XLSX, or INSERT statements.

### Schema Tools

- **Schema browser** — databases, schemas, tables, columns, indexes, foreign keys, triggers, with sidebar search & pin
- **Object browser** — grouped procedures, functions, views, and source editing where supported
- **Table structure editor** — reviewable column and index changes for supported engines
- **ER diagram** — visualize table relationships
- **Schema diff** — compare structures across connections
- **Explain plan** — visual query execution plan
- **Field lineage** — column-level lineage analysis
- **Database search** — find objects across large schemas

### Data Operations

- **Table import** — CSV, Excel
- **Data transfer** — migrate between databases
- **Database export** — full database dump
- **Data compare** — compare table data and review synchronization output
- **SQL file execution** — run `.sql` files directly
- **File preview** — drag & drop Parquet, CSV, JSON to preview instantly (powered by DuckDB)
- **Connection import** — bring connection profiles from DBeaver or Navicat

### Specialized Browsers

- **Redis** — key pattern search, batch key operations, command runner, TTL editing, and all data types (String, Hash, List, Set, ZSet, Stream)
- **MongoDB** — document CRUD with pagination, Atlas & replica set URL connection

### Safety & Connectivity

SSH tunnel (key & password) · database and AI proxy settings · auto-reconnect on connection loss · confirmation dialogs for destructive operations · encrypted config export/import · color-coded connections · driver store and optional JDBC plugin

### Polished UI

Dark mode with native title bar sync · 9 editor themes · English, 简体中文 & Español · layout preferences · built-in auto-update

## AI Agent Integration (MCP)

Arch-GPT DB provides a separate [Rust-powered MCP server](packages/mcp-server/) that lets AI coding agents query databases using connections configured in Arch-GPT DB. The MCP server is distributed independently from the desktop application, so installing Arch-GPT DB does not automatically install the MCP executable.

```bash
npx @dbx-app/mcp-server
```

Add to your `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbx": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@dbx-app/mcp-server"] }
  }
}
```

Manage the connection allowlist and the **Read only**, **Data read/write**, and **Full access** modes in **Arch-GPT DB Settings → MCP**. The machine-readable values remain `read_only`, `safe_write`, and `high_risk_write`; client configs do not need permission or connection-scope environment variables.

For upgrade compatibility, an existing `DBX_MCP_ALLOW_WRITES=0` (or `false`) remains a read-only restriction only until a central MCP policy is saved for the first time; it can never enable writes or override a saved policy.

Windows portable builds need `ARCH_GPT_DB_DATA_DIR` in the MCP config, pointing to the `data` directory next to `Arch-GPT DB.exe` (the folder that contains `dbx.db`).

For Arch-GPT DB Web or Docker deployments, point the MCP server at the Web backend API. If the Web login page requires a password, set `ARCH_GPT_DB_WEB_PASSWORD` to the same password used there:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pandb": {
      "command": "pandb-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "ARCH_GPT_DB_WEB_URL": "http://localhost:4224",
        "ARCH_GPT_DB_WEB_PASSWORD": "your-web-login-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible agent. Supports listing connections, browsing tables, executing SQL, and opening tables directly in Arch-GPT DB's UI.

## Installation

Arch-GPT DB is currently distributed from source while its first public release is prepared. Clone this repository and follow the development instructions below. Existing installations remain compatible during the transition, but legacy download channels are not Arch-GPT DB release channels.

## Self-Hosted (Docker)

Build and run the Web edition from this checkout:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:4224` after the containers are ready. To publish under a reverse-proxy context path such as `/pandb`, use the new runtime variables:

```yaml
environment:
  - ARCH_GPT_DB_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/pandb
```

When building the frontend with an absolute asset base, set `VITE_ARCH_GPT_DB_BASE_PATH=/pandb/` before `pnpm build`. The legacy `DBX_*` forms remain supported for existing deployments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) >= 1.88

#### System Dependencies

**macOS:**

No additional dependencies required.

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf libssl-dev
```

**NIXOS/NIX :** 

<a href="README-NIX.md">See README-NIX.md</a>

**Windows:**

No additional dependencies required.

### Development

```bash
make
```

`make` installs root dependencies when needed and starts the local Tauri desktop development environment.

Development builds can run alongside an installed Arch-GPT DB instance and share its local data, including connections and history. Avoid changing the same connection or global setting in both windows at once.

> [!TIP]
> DuckDB compilation takes a while. If you're not working on DuckDB features,
> skip it to speed up local builds:
>
> ```bash
> # Fast checks (skip DuckDB)
> make cargo-check-fast
> make cargo-test-fast
>
> # Tauri dev without DuckDB
> make dev-fast
> ```
>
> The `--no-default-features` flag only affects local development.
> Release builds (`pnpm tauri build`) always include DuckDB.

Web version:

```bash
make dev-web       # frontend
make dev-backend   # backend
```

Documentation site:

```bash
make docs
```

The official Arch-GPT DB documentation site lives in `docs/`. If you want to improve the website content or documentation pages, edit the files under `docs/` and run `make docs` to preview the site locally.

For clean, reproducible local database instances, use the versioned Docker Compose recipes under [`deploy/database/`](deploy/database/README.md):

```bash
make db-list
make db-verify DB=mysql@8.4
```

JDBC agent driver development projects live in `agents/`:

```bash
cd agents
./gradlew test
```

Build artifacts from `agents/drivers/<db-type>/build/libs/` are picked up by local driver install flows when available.

### Build

```bash
make package
```

The installer will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
